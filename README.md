# SimpleWindowsManager

Planned functionality:
  [ ] switching windows using only keyboard (kinda sorta working)
  [ ] moving active window around a pre-configured grid

TODO:
  [ ] load binding from file (and check if hotkey is registered)
  [ ] add notifyIcon with contextmenu (bring to front and exit)
  [ ] start without window - with only notify icon
  [ ] remove WindowSwitcher from alt-tab list
